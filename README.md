Data Source: Yahoo Finance (https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/download/BTC-USD?period1=1410912000&period2=1678147200&interval=1mo&events=history&includeAdjustedClose=true)

I created a #PowerBI dashboard for #cryptocurrency Users that wanted to #analyze #btcusd performance since September 2014 till date. The dashboard had several visuals that highlighted average prices and trends.
First, created a Date Slicer, This allowed users to select date range to see #BTCUSD average prices, pattern, trends, and performances for the selected date range.
I created #metrics and visuals that showed the performance of #BTCUSD over 10 years. This allowed #BTCUSD users to identify the days, months, and years BTCUSD pumped most and compare the performance of other months and years.

I added Cards that displayed the Average Open, Average Close, Average High, Average Low, and Average Volume of BTCUSD over the specific months and years. This allowed the users to identify the performances of BTC by each price categories for the timeframe. 

Included a clustered bar chat that showed the BTCUSD trends over time. This allowed the users to see how the pair volume has been increasing, decreasing, or remaining steady.

Included a line and stacked column chart that showed the trend of BTCUSD average volume and average close price with the date. This allowed users to identify the average close price and average volume for each year.
Added a Donut chart that showed the percentage rate of average open price with average close price, average high price, and average low price. This allowed the users to identify what're the open/close and high/low prices and their percentages for any selected and filtered date.
Finally, I added a Line chart that showed the BTCUSD average close price trends over time. This allowed users how BTCUSD has been pumping, dumping, or remaining steady price and allowed users to see the average close price for each month. Also, It allowed the users to see the forecasted BTCUSD prices for the next 10 months.
